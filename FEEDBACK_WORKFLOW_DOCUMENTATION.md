# Customer Feedback & Service Closure Workflow

This document describes the implementation of the Customer Feedback & Service Closure Workflow feature for the Service CRM system.

## Overview

The Customer Feedback & Service Closure Workflow provides a comprehensive system for collecting customer feedback after service completion and managing the formal closure of service tickets with proper approval workflows.

## Features

### Customer Feedback System
- **Structured Feedback Collection**: Multi-dimensional rating system (overall, service quality, technician, timeliness, communication)
- **Survey Support**: Flexible survey responses with JSON storage for custom questions
- **Satisfaction Tracking**: Recommendation tracking and satisfaction level categorization
- **Follow-up Preferences**: Customer contact preferences for follow-up actions
- **Status Management**: Workflow status tracking (submitted → reviewed → responded → closed)

### Service Closure Workflow
- **Manager Approval**: Configurable manager approval requirements for service closure
- **Closure Reasons**: Structured closure reasons (completed, cancelled, customer request, no-show)
- **Feedback Integration**: Links closure process with customer feedback requirements
- **Escalation Management**: Automatic escalation detection for low ratings or issues
- **Reopening Tracking**: Complete audit trail for service reopenings

## Database Models

### CustomerFeedback
- Multi-dimensional ratings (1-5 scale)
- Text feedback and improvement suggestions
- Survey responses (JSON field for flexibility)
- Satisfaction level and recommendation tracking
- Follow-up preferences
- Review workflow with manager responses

### ServiceClosure
- Closure workflow status and reasons
- Manager approval process
- Feedback integration requirements
- Escalation tracking
- Reopening audit trail

## API Endpoints

### Customer Feedback
- `POST /api/v1/feedback/feedback` - Submit feedback
- `GET /api/v1/feedback/feedback` - List feedback with filters
- `GET /api/v1/feedback/feedback/{id}` - Get specific feedback
- `PUT /api/v1/feedback/feedback/{id}` - Update feedback
- `POST /api/v1/feedback/feedback/{id}/review` - Review feedback

### Service Closure
- `POST /api/v1/feedback/service-closure` - Create closure request
- `GET /api/v1/feedback/service-closure` - List closures with filters
- `GET /api/v1/feedback/service-closure/{id}` - Get specific closure
- `POST /api/v1/feedback/service-closure/{id}/approve` - Approve closure
- `POST /api/v1/feedback/service-closure/{id}/close` - Close service
- `POST /api/v1/feedback/service-closure/{id}/reopen` - Reopen service

### Analytics
- `GET /api/v1/feedback/feedback/analytics/summary` - Feedback analytics
- `GET /api/v1/feedback/service-closure/analytics/summary` - Closure analytics

## RBAC Permissions

### Customer Feedback Module
- `customer_feedback_submit` - Submit feedback (customers)
- `customer_feedback_read` - View feedback (staff, managers)
- `customer_feedback_update` - Update/review feedback (managers)

### Service Closure Module
- `service_closure_create` - Create closure requests (staff)
- `service_closure_read` - View closures (staff, managers)
- `service_closure_approve` - Approve closures (managers only)
- `service_closure_close` - Close services (managers only)

## Frontend Components

### CustomerFeedbackModal
- Comprehensive feedback form with rating system
- Survey question support
- Satisfaction level selection
- Follow-up preferences

### ServiceClosureDialog
- Closure workflow management
- Manager approval interface
- Escalation handling
- Reopening functionality

### FeedbackStatusList
- Dashboard view of feedback and closures
- Filtering and search capabilities
- Status tracking and analytics

### FeedbackWorkflowIntegration
- Integration component for existing dispatch management
- Role-based action buttons
- Status indicators
- Context menus

## Workflow Integration

### Dispatch Service Integration
The workflow is integrated with the existing dispatch service:

1. **Job Completion**: When a job is completed, the dispatch service triggers the feedback workflow
2. **Email Notification**: Automatic feedback request emails are sent to customers
3. **Feedback Collection**: Customers can submit feedback through the modal interface
4. **Closure Process**: Managers can create and manage service closures
5. **Analytics**: Real-time analytics track satisfaction and closure metrics

### Business Rules
- Feedback requests are triggered automatically on job completion
- Service closures require customer feedback for quality control
- Manager approval is required for service closure (configurable)
- Low ratings (≤2) automatically trigger escalation
- Multiple reopenings (≥2) trigger escalation
- Analytics track satisfaction trends and closure efficiency

## Usage Examples

### For Customers
1. Receive automated feedback request email after service completion
2. Click feedback link or access through customer portal
3. Submit comprehensive feedback with ratings and comments
4. Track feedback status and responses

### For Managers
1. Monitor incoming feedback through dashboard
2. Review and respond to customer feedback
3. Approve or reject service closure requests
4. Handle escalations for low satisfaction scores
5. Analyze satisfaction trends and service performance

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Model validation and relationships
- Service layer business logic
- API endpoint functionality
- Frontend component behavior
- Workflow integration scenarios

## Future Enhancements
