# Voucher Management & Product Module Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the voucher management and product modules as per the requirements.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Financial Voucher Numbering System ✅

**Issue**: Financial vouchers were missing consistent sequential voucher numbering.

**Solution**:
- Fixed missing `VoucherNumberService` imports in `payment_voucher.py`
- All financial vouchers now use the existing `VoucherNumberService.generate_voucher_number()` method
- Voucher numbers follow format: `{PREFIX}/{FISCAL_YEAR}/{SEQUENCE}` (e.g., `PMT/2425/00000001`)
- Each voucher type has its own prefix:
  - Payment: `PMT`
  - Receipt: `RCT` 
  - Journal: `JNL`
  - Contra: `CNT`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/v1/vouchers/payment_voucher.py`

### 2. Financial Voucher UI Standardization ✅

**Issue**: Financial vouchers used single-column layout instead of index-left, form-right layout.

**Solution**:
- Updated all financial voucher UIs to use consistent two-column layout
- Left column (40%): Voucher index/list with table view
- Right column (60%): Form with all action buttons
- Added proper table structure with context menus
- Matches the layout pattern used by sales vouchers

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/vouchers/Financial-Vouchers/payment-voucher.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/vouchers/Financial-Vouchers/receipt-voucher.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/vouchers/Financial-Vouchers/journal-voucher.tsx`

### 3. Master Data Navigation ✅

**Issue**: Master Data options should open specific modules instead of generic page.

**Status**: ✅ Already implemented correctly
- Customer link redirects to `/masters?tab=customers`
- Vendor link redirects to `/masters?tab=vendors` 
- Product link redirects to `/masters?tab=products`
- Direct navigation to specific modules is working as intended

### 4. GST Certificate Upload ✅

**Issue**: Need to add GST certificate upload functionality for customers and vendors.

**Solution**:

#### Backend Changes:
- Added `CustomerFile` and `VendorFile` models with `file_type` field
- Added comprehensive file upload endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/customers/{id}/files` - Upload customer files
  - `GET /api/v1/customers/{id}/files` - List customer files
  - `GET /api/v1/customers/{id}/files/{file_id}/download` - Download files
  - `DELETE /api/v1/customers/{id}/files/{file_id}` - Delete files
  - Similar endpoints for vendors
- PDF validation for GST certificates
- File size limits (10MB) and count limits (10 files per entity)
- Proper organization-based access control

#### Frontend Changes:
- Added "Add GST Certificate" button in customer/vendor modals
- File upload with progress indication
- PDF file validation
- Automatic upload on file selection

**Files Modified**:
- `app/models/base.py` - Added CustomerFile, VendorFile models
- `app/schemas/base.py` - Added file response schemas
- `app/api/customers.py` - Added file upload endpoints
- `app/api/vendors.py` - Added file upload endpoints
- `frontend/src/pages/masters/index.tsx` - Added upload functionality

### 5. Product File Upload Enhancement ✅

**Issue**: Need to ensure product file upload supports multiple files with preview.

**Status**: ✅ Already implemented comprehensively
- Supports up to 5 files per product
- Multiple file selection in single operation
- File preview for supported types (PDF, images)
- Complete CRUD operations for product files
- File list display under each product

**Existing Implementation**:
- `app/api/products.py` - Comprehensive file upload API
- File upload directory: `uploads/products`
- 10MB file size limit
- Proper file validation and storage

### 6. Voucher Startup Issues ✅

**Issue**: Payment vouchers, receipt vouchers may have startup issues.

**Solution**:
- Fixed missing `VoucherNumberService` imports
- All voucher types can now be properly initiated
- Voucher number generation works correctly for all financial vouchers
- Endpoints properly registered and accessible

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suites:

### Backend Tests:
- `tests/test_gst_certificate_upload.py` - Tests GST certificate upload functionality
- `tests/test_financial_voucher_functionality.py` - Tests voucher numbering and endpoints
- `verify_implementation.py` - Verification script for imports and basic functionality

### Test Coverage:
- ✅ GST certificate upload endpoints exist and are accessible
- ✅ Financial voucher numbering service is properly imported
- ✅ All voucher endpoints are registered correctly
- ✅ File upload validation works
- ✅ Database models and relationships are correct

## API Endpoints Added

### Customer File Management:
```
POST   /api/v1/customers/{customer_id}/files
GET    /api/v1/customers/{customer_id}/files
GET    /api/v1/customers/{customer_id}/files/{file_id}/download
DELETE /api/v1/customers/{customer_id}/files/{file_id}
```

### Vendor File Management:
```
POST   /api/v1/vendors/{vendor_id}/files
GET    /api/v1/vendors/{vendor_id}/files
GET    /api/v1/vendors/{vendor_id}/files/{file_id}/download
DELETE /api/v1/vendors/{vendor_id}/files/{file_id}
```

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables:
- `customer_files` - Stores customer file attachments
- `vendor_files` - Stores vendor file attachments

### New Columns:
- `file_type` field to categorize file types (general, gst_certificate, pan_card, etc.)

### Relationships:
- `Customer.files` → `CustomerFile`
- `Vendor.files` → `VendorFile`

## UI/UX Improvements

### Financial Vouchers:
- ✅ Consistent two-column layout across all financial vouchers
- ✅ Left panel shows voucher index with quick access
- ✅ Right panel contains form with all action buttons
- ✅ Proper table structure with context menus
- ✅ Responsive design that adapts to screen size

### Master Data:
- ✅ GST certificate upload button in customer/vendor modals
- ✅ File upload progress indication
- ✅ PDF validation feedback
- ✅ Clean, intuitive interface

## Migration Notes

### Database Migration:
The new `CustomerFile` and `VendorFile` tables will be created automatically by SQLAlchemy when the application starts. No manual migration is required.

### File Storage:
- Customer files: `uploads/customers/`
- Vendor files: `uploads/vendors/`
- Product files: `uploads/products/` (existing)

Ensure these directories have proper write permissions.

## Verification Steps

1. **Run Verification Script**:
   ```bash
   cd v1.1
   python verify_implementation.py
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd v1.1
   python tests/test_gst_certificate_upload.py
   python tests/test_financial_voucher_functionality.py
   ```

3. **Manual Testing**:
   - Create payment/receipt vouchers to verify numbering
   - Upload GST certificates in customer/vendor modals
   - Verify financial voucher UI layout is consistent
   - Test file download and deletion functionality

## Summary

All requested improvements have been successfully implemented:

- ✅ **Voucher Numbering**: Financial vouchers use consistent sequential numbering
- ✅ **Voucher Startup**: All voucher types can be properly initiated  
- ✅ **UI Standardization**: Financial vouchers use index-left, form-right layout
- ✅ **Master Data Navigation**: Already working correctly
- ✅ **GST Certificate Upload**: Comprehensive file upload system for customers/vendors
- ✅ **Product File Upload**: Already robust with 5-file support and preview

The implementation is production-ready with proper error handling, validation, and security measures.
