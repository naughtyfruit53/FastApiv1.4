# Organization ID Standardization Update

## Overview

This update standardizes the use of `organization_id` throughout the FastAPI backend and frontend to ensure consistent multi-tenant data management and API design.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Database Schema** 
   - Updated Alembic migration to create all tables with proper `organization_id` foreign key constraints
   - All tenant-aware models (User, Customer, Vendor, Product, Stock, etc.) now consistently use `organization_id`
   - Maintains support for super admin users where `organization_id` can be `NULL`

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Updated organization management endpoints to use `/{organization_id}` instead of `/{org_id}` in path parameters
   - Updated settings endpoints to use consistent `organization_id` parameters
   - Updated user management endpoints to use consistent `organization_id` parameters

3. **Variable Names**
   - Refactored variable names throughout backend code from `org_id` to `organization_id` for consistency

### Frontend Changes

1. **Services**
   - Updated all localStorage references from `'org_id'` to `'organization_id'`
   - Updated API service calls to use consistent `organization_id` parameter names
   - Updated organization service to store/retrieve `organization_id` consistently

2. **API Client**
   - Updated API interceptor to use `'organization_id'` in headers and localStorage
   - Updated error handling to clean up `'organization_id'` on authentication failures

## Migration Instructions

### For Existing Deployments

1. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Run the updated Alembic migration
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Frontend Updates**
   - Clear browser localStorage for existing users to reset organization data
   - Update any custom frontend integrations to use `organization_id` instead of `org_id`

3. **API Integration Updates**
   - Update any external API clients to use the new endpoint paths:
     - `GET /api/v1/organizations/{organization_id}` (was `/{org_id}`)
     - `PUT /api/v1/organizations/{organization_id}` (was `/{org_id}`)
     - `DELETE /api/v1/organizations/{organization_id}` (was `/{org_id}`)
     - `GET /api/v1/organizations/{organization_id}/users` (was `/{org_id}/users`)
     - Similar updates for settings endpoints

### Super Admin Compatibility

- Super admin users continue to work as before
- Super admins can have `organization_id = NULL` in the database
- Super admin API access remains unrestricted across organizations
- Platform-level operations continue to support `organization_id = None`

## Validation

A validation script (`validate_organization_id_consistency.py`) has been included to verify:

- Database schema uses `organization_id` consistently
- API endpoints use `{organization_id}` path parameters
- Frontend services use `'organization_id'` in localStorage
- Data isolation works correctly between organizations
- Super admin access patterns function properly

Run validation with:
```bash
python validate_organization_id_consistency.py
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Unified naming convention across all layers
2. **Clarity**: More descriptive parameter names improve code readability  
3. **Maintainability**: Consistent patterns make future development easier
4. **Multi-tenancy**: Stronger enforcement of organization-level data isolation
5. **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with clear resource identification

## Backward Compatibility

⚠️ **Breaking Changes**: This update includes breaking changes to API endpoint paths. Ensure all client applications are updated before deployment.

The following endpoints have changed:
- Organization management endpoints now use `{organization_id}` instead of `{org_id}`
- Settings endpoints now use `{organization_id}` instead of `{org_id}`
- User management endpoints now use consistent `{organization_id}` parameters

## Testing

- All changes have been validated with comprehensive test cases
- Database constraints properly enforce organization relationships
- API endpoints correctly handle organization scoping
- Frontend localStorage usage is consistent
- Super admin flows continue to work correctly
