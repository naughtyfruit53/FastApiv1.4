## 🔐 RBAC Security Implementation

### Customer Permissions
- `customer_feedback_submit` - Submit service feedback

### Staff Permissions  
- `customer_feedback_read` - View feedback data
- `service_closure_create` - Create closure requests
- `service_closure_read` - View closure status

### Manager Permissions
- `customer_feedback_update` - Review and respond to feedback
- `service_closure_approve` - Approve closure requests
- `service_closure_close` - Close service tickets
- `service_reports_read` - Access analytics data

## 🔄 Business Workflow

### 1. Service Completion Flow
```
Job Completed → CompletionRecord Created → Feedback Email Sent → Customer Submits Feedback
```

### 2. Closure Approval Flow
```
Closure Requested → Manager Review → Approval/Rejection → Service Closed → Analytics Updated
```

### 3. Escalation Flow
```
Low Rating (≤2) → Auto-Escalation → Manager Notification → Follow-up Action
```
