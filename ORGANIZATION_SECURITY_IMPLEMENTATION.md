# Organization Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation removes all localStorage usage for organization_id and implements a secure, session-based organization context system for the FastAPI/Next.js application.

## Key Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Added `/api/v1/organizations/current` endpoints:**
   - `GET /api/v1/organizations/current` - Returns user's organization from session
   - `PUT /api/v1/organizations/current` - Updates user's organization (org admin only)

2. **Updated authentication dependencies:**
   - Removed `X-Organization-ID` header requirement from `get_current_user()`
   - Organization context derived exclusively from JWT token/session
   - No client-side headers affect backend organization context

3. **Session-based security:**
   - All organization access validated against authenticated user's session
   - Organization ID cannot be manipulated via client-side storage

### Frontend Changes

1. **AuthContext enhancements:**
   - Organization ID stored only in React Context (memory)
   - Added `isOrgContextReady` flag for hardened authentication flow
   - Created `useAuthWithOrgContext()` hook for components requiring org context
   - Added validation: regular users must have organization_id to complete authentication

2. **API client security:**
   - Removed all `X-Organization-ID` header sending
   - Organization context derived from backend session automatically
   - Simplified request interceptors

3. **Service layer cleanup:**
   - Removed all `localStorage.setItem('organization_id')` calls
   - Removed all `localStorage.getItem('organization_id')` calls
   - Updated all API methods to rely on backend session context

4. **Component updates:**
   - Updated user management to wait for org context before rendering
   - Added loading states for organization context initialization
   - Removed unused OrganizationContext and related files

## Security Benefits

1. **Tamper-proof organization context:** Cannot be modified via browser storage
2. **Consistent state:** Organization context always matches backend session
3. **Secure session management:** All organization access validated server-side
4. **Hardened authentication:** Dashboard blocked until valid org context loaded
5. **Memory-only storage:** Organization data exists only during active session

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
- Use `useAuthWithOrgContext()` instead of `useAuth()` for components requiring organization context
- Organization ID is available via `user.organization_id` from AuthContext
- No need to manually pass organization_id in API requests
- Backend automatically applies organization filtering based on authenticated user

### For API Endpoints
- Remove any `X-Organization-ID` header reading
- Use `get_current_user()` dependency to get organization context
- Organization filtering applied automatically via user's session

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Component
```typescript
import { useAuthWithOrgContext } from '../context/AuthContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { user, isReady } = useAuthWithOrgContext();
  
  if (!isReady) {
    return <div>Loading organization context...</div>;
  }
  
  // Now safe to use user.organization_id
  return <div>Organization: {user?.organization_id}</div>;
};
```

### Backend Endpoint
```python
@router.get("/my-data")
async def get_my_data(
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    # Organization context automatically available via current_user.organization_id
    return db.query(MyModel).filter(
        MyModel.organization_id == current_user.organization_id
    ).all()
```

## Testing

The implementation includes a comprehensive test script (`test_organization_security.py`) that validates:
- Zero localStorage organization_id usage
- No X-Organization-ID headers sent
- Proper authentication flow
- Backend endpoint availability

Run with: `python test_organization_security.py`

## Single-Org-Per-User Model

This implementation enforces a single-org-per-user SaaS model where:
- Each user belongs to exactly one organization
- Organization context is immutable during session
- No organization switching functionality
- Super admins exempt from organization requirements
- Supabase as the single source of truth for organization relationships
